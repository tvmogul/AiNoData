# AiNoData™
My name is #Bill SerGio# and I am the inventor of Decision Space™, a new mathematical construct for decision-making. This work introduces a mathematical framework defining a Decision Space where candidate actions or states are evaluated, scored, and selected using deterministic cost, energy, and risk functions, without learned weights, probabilities, or historical data.

# Zero-Training AI™ — Interactive Demos

**Four deterministic, real-time decision systems that do not use training data, datasets, or machine learning.**

This repository contains a set of interactive web-based demonstrations showcasing **Zero-Training AI™** — a class of decision and optimization systems that operate through **mathematical evaluation at runtime**, rather than statistical learning from data.

At the core of this work is my creation of a **new mathematical framework for decision-making**, including the formalization of a **Decision Space™**: a structured space in which candidate actions or states are evaluated, scored, and selected based on deterministic cost, energy, and risk functions.  
Decisions emerge from direct evaluation within this Decision Space™, not from learned weights, probabilities, or historical examples.

These demos are intentionally simple, visual, and self-contained, designed to show how certain classes of problems can be solved without training, models, or inference pipelines.

## 🚀 What Is Zero-Training AI™?

Zero-Training AI™ refers to systems that:

- Require **no training data**
- Use **no machine learning models**
- Perform **real-time evaluation and selection**
- Produce **deterministic, explainable outcomes**
- Remain stable under changing inputs and constraints

Instead of learning from historical examples, these systems operate by:

- Evaluating candidate states or actions within a defined **Decision Space**
- Applying mathematical cost, energy, or risk functions
- Selecting stable or optimal configurations at runtime

This approach is particularly useful in domains where:

- Decisions must be made instantly
- Training data is unavailable, unreliable, or dangerous
- Explainability and determinism matter
- Post-generation control is required
