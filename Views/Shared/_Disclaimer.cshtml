    <p>
        Zero-Training AI™ is a proprietary decision-optimization technology demonstrated here
        for informational and educational purposes only.
        The demonstrations on this website are simplified visual and interactive examples
        intended to illustrate conceptual behavior, not operational systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        These demos do <strong>not</strong> represent physical simulations, real-world control systems,
        autonomous vehicles, medical devices, financial instruments, or deployed safety-critical systems.
        Any visual motion, scaling, or behavior shown is a mathematical or illustrative abstraction
        and should not be interpreted as modeling real energy, force, thrust, risk, or physical dynamics.
    </p>

    <p>
        Zero-Training AI™ does not rely on training data, datasets, machine learning models,
        or statistical inference. Outputs shown are generated through deterministic
        mathematical evaluation and decision-selection logic applied at runtime.
    </p>

    <p>
        No representation is made that these demonstrations are complete, production-ready,
        error-free, or suitable for any specific use without further engineering, validation,
        testing, and regulatory review.
